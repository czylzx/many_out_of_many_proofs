# Kunlun: A Modern Crypto Library

## Overview

I give a C++ wrapper for OpenSSL, making it handy to use, without worrying about the cumbersome memory management and memorizing the complex interfaces. Based on this wrapper, I am going to build an efficient and modular crypto library. 

## Design Philosophy

Provide a set of neat interfaces for big integer and ec group operations, with the hope that the code is as succinct as paper description. Kunlun supports multithreading via OpenMP. So far, the library is not stable. It will keep evolving. 

## Issues

* OpenSSL does not support pre-computation for customized generator.
* bn_ctx is not thread-safe, so in many places it is hard to apply the SIMD parallel optimization. 
* A dirty trick is to make openssl-based programs parallizable is to set bn_ctx = nullptr. This trick works for some cases but not all, and only beats the single-thread programs when THREAD_NUM is much larger than 1.  

If the above two issues get solved, the performance of Kunlun will be better.

## To do list (impossible missions for me)

* PRF  
* garbled circuit
* secret sharing
* zk-SNARK
* add class for Zn and ECPoint/BigInt vector
* wrap _m128i as class?
* silient OT
* overload << >> for serialization


## Specifications

- OS: MAC OS x64, Linux x64
- Language: C++
- Requires: OpenSSL, OpenMP

## Install Depedent Libaraies
### On MACOS
* download the latest OpenSSL from the website, to support curve25519, 
modify crypto/ec/curve25519.c line 211: remove "static", then compile it:
```
  $ ./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc shared enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 no-ssl2 no-ssl3 no-comp --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl/macos-x86_64
  $ make depend
  $ sudo make install
```

test if the function x25519_scalar_mulx is available
```
  $ cd /usr/local/lib
  $ nm libcrypto.a | grep x25519_scalar_mulx
```

* install OpenMP
```
  $ brew install libomp 
```


### On Linux
* install OpenSSL 3.0
do the same modification as in MACOS, then compile it according to
```
  https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation#Linux
```

* install OpenMP
```
  $ sudo apt install libomp-dev 
```

## Compile and Run
```

  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ ./test_xxx 
```

## Multi-threads Support
- Kunlun supports multithread by leveraging openmp. Since OpenSSL is not thread-safe, 
I slightly hack the code to work around using the following facts about bn_ctx: 
* bn_ctx is necessary for most big number operations, but not necessary for elliptic curve crypto operations. 
* bn_ctx can improve the performance
* one can set bn_ctx = nullptr for thread safety when dealing with ECC operations
* one could still use the original bn_ctx in single thread setting    

- The global setting for multi-thread support lies at "include/global.hpp" line 21-22
algorithms in ec_point.hpp will be complied according to this setting

- For multi-thread
```
#define PARALLEL
const static size_t thread_count = 8; // maximum thread count 
```

- For single-thread
```
//#define PARALLEL
const static size_t thread_count = 1; // maximum thread count 
```

## Acknowledgement

We deeply thank [Weiran Liu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/liu-wei-ran-8-34) for many helpful discussions on the development of this library. Here we strongly recommend the efficient and easy-to-use [MPC library for Java](https://github.com/alibaba-edu/mpc4j) developed by his team. 
I thank my deer senior apprentice [Prof. Zhi Guan](http://gmssl.org/) for professional help. 

## Tips

* thread vector is more efficient than thread array: I don't know the reason why
* add mutex to lock bn_ctx will severely harm the performance of multi thread 
* void* type pointer allow you to determine the exact type later and provide a unified interface

## How to test the speed of socket communication?

1. install iperf3 via the following command
```
brew install iperf3
```

2. open it in two terminals (perhaps on two computers)
```
iperf3 -s
iperf3 -c [IP Address of first Mac]
```
